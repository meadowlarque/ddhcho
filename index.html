        		<h2>A programmer, a historian, and a librarian walk into a bar...</h2>
				<p>…and over drinks, chat about what they are working on, and how they might be able to collaborate on fascinating new interdisciplinary projects! <em>[Did you really think that setup would produce a funny punchline?]</em></p>

<p>Decoding Digital Humanities Charlottesville is a new monthly discussion group for those in Central VA (and beyond) who would like to connect with others in the community. Whether you are brand new to the field or a conference regular, we encourage you to come out and share ideas, questions, or just enthuse about your latest interest! Our gatherings will be informal, but we will post optional readings prior to each meeting to provide prompts for discussion. Based upon a model of the originating chapter in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ddhlondon/home">London</a>, the group members typically consist of university students, staff and faculty in the humanities, but we are open to all: especially programmers, engineers, artists, 3D modelers, teachers, librarians, museum curators, archivists, archaeologists, and any others who think that technology and cultural heritage go hand in hand.</p>

<p>See our list of links for more information about the field of Digital Humanities, and <a href="mailto:decodingdhcho@gmail.com">contact us</a> if you have any questions! However, if your first is "what is Digital Humanities?" then <strong><a title="What is Digital Humanities?" href="https://decodingdh.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/hello-world/">start here!</a></strong></p>
