        		<h2>A programmer, a historian, and a librarian walk into a bar...</h2>
				<p>…and over drinks, chat about what they are working on, and how they might be able to collaborate on fascinating new interdisciplinary projects! <em>[Did you really think that setup would produce a funny punchline?]</em></p>

<p>Decoding Digital Humanities Charlottesville is a new monthly discussion group for those in Central VA (and beyond) who would like to connect with others in the community. Whether you are brand new to the field or a conference regular, we encourage you to come out and share ideas, questions, or just enthuse about your latest interest! Our gatherings will be informal, but we will post optional readings prior to each meeting to provide prompts for discussion. Based upon a model of the originating chapter in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ddhlondon/home">London</a>, the group members typically consist of university students, staff and faculty in the humanities, but we are open to all: especially programmers, engineers, artists, 3D modelers, teachers, librarians, museum curators, archivists, archaeologists, and any others who think that technology and cultural heritage go hand in hand.</p>

<p>See our list of links for more information about the field of Digital Humanities, and <a href="mailto:decodingdhcho@gmail.com">contact us</a> if you have any questions! However, if your first is "what is Digital Humanities?" then <strong><a href="#whatis">start here!</a></strong></p>

    			<h2>What is Digital Humanities?</h2>
    			<p>Good question. There are a lot of people trying to sort this out:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com">What is Digital Humanities?</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://medium.com/digital-humanities/defining-digital-humanities-45a4b5765680">Defining Digital Humanities: Online Essay</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Defining-Digital-Humanities-Melissa-Terras-ebook/dp/B00GY958XA">Defining Digital Humanities: Book (Amazon)</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/definingdh">DefiningDH: Twitter </a></li>
	<li><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=digital+humanities">and many more</a>!</li>
</ul>
However, it is often broadly described as the intersection of computer science and the study of the humanities. At a practical level, it seeks to find out if we can improve our knowledge of topics such as history, literature, art and philosophy by using and creating new technological tools. On a theoretical level, it evaluates the implications of technological intervention on its subjects and its role in education in general. As such, it can be both an academic discipline and a methodology. It can be practiced individually: a linguistics student using a python script to analyze word stems in a 17th century Spanish novella; organizationally: a university department consisting of a team of programmers and DH theorists helping a history professor visualize census data for a new publication.
